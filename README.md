## Building
Gradle 8.1.1 and Groovy 3.0.15 require running the build with JDK 17.
The repository ships a `.tool-versions` file so environments using
[`mise`](https://github.com/jdx/mise) will automatically select Java 17.
If you are not using `mise`, make sure `JAVA_HOME` points to a Java 17 JDK
before executing Gradle tasks.
